    <p>email: connor.o.keyes@ou.edu</p>
    <div>I am working towards my bachelors degree in MIS. I am interested in going into the IT industry, helping others solve problems has always been something that I have enjoyed. 
    That coupled with my interest in computers makes IT a very appealing choice. My experience working for the University of Oklahoma and OG&E has helped me add to my understanding of computers. 
    I have had to work with databases in both of these positions, and my internship with OG&E's cyber security team has given me a general understanding of information security best practices.</div>
